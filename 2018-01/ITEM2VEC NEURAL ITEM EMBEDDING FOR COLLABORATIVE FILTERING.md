# ITEM2VEC NEURAL ITEM EMBEDDING FOR COLLABORATIVE FILTERING [1]

## Keywords
word2vec, collaborative filtering, recommender systems, item recommendations

## Inovations
1. In order to overcome the imbalance between rare and frequent words the following subsampling procedure is proposed [2]: Given the input word sequence, we discard each word w with a probability<img src='images/1.jpg'>where f (w) is the frequency of the word w and œÅ is a prescribedthreshold. This procedure was reported to accelerate the learning process and to improve the representation of rare words significantly.

## Evaluations
Comparing the performance of item2vec with item2item SVD on clustering.
